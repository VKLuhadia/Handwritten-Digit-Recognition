# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
Handwritten Digit Recognition | Neural Networks [Aug 2023 - Sep 2023]
Self Project
• Detects the scanned images of handwritten digits using MNIST dataset made with the help of Neural Network.
• Approached by using a three layered neural network - input layer (distributes the features of our examples to the next
layer for calculation of activations of the next layer), hidden layer (made of hidden units called activations providing
nonlinear ties for the network) and output layer (provides us with the final prediction of the Neural Network)
• Consists of multiple layers having many activations, which resemble to neurons of our brain and Tries to learn a set of
parameters in a set of data which could help to recognize the underlying relationships
